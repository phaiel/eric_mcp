/**
 * Turn a raw tool-execution failure into a coarse classification plus a
 * human-readable, actionable hint. The goal is that a trial user testing a
 * tool sees "The API key was rejected — check the key and its header" instead
 * of a bare "Request failed with status code 401". Auth hints are tailored to
 * the connector's authType so the advice points at the right field.
