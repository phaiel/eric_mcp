## Code of Conduct

This project follows the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you agree to uphold this code.

## License

AnythingMCP is open source under the [GNU Affero General Public License v3](LICENSE) (AGPL-3.0-only). Code under `ee/` directories is licensed separately under the [AnythingMCP Commercial License](packages/backend/src/ee/LICENSE). See the [License FAQ](docs/license-faq.md) for a plain-language explanation.

### Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

Before we can merge your first pull request, you must sign our
[Contributor License Agreement](CLA.md). An automated check on your PR
will ask you to sign by posting a comment — it takes one click and
only needs to be done once.

**You retain copyright over your contributions.** The CLA grants
helpcode.ai GmbH a license to use and re-license your contribution;
this is what allows us to offer AnythingMCP under both the AGPL and a
commercial license while keeping a single codebase.

## AI-assisted contributions

We use AI assistants (Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, etc.) in our own development and we welcome contributions made with the same tools. The standards are the same as any human contribution:

- You take responsibility for the code you submit — review every line before opening a PR.
- The catalog test suite (`npm test`) must pass.
- Adapter JSON must validate against [`docs/tool-definition.md`](docs/tool-definition.md).
- Don't paste AI output blindly into the PR description; write the *why* in your own words.

We will not refuse a PR because it was AI-assisted, and we will not single it out either. See [AUTHORS.md](AUTHORS.md) for how we use AI ourselves.

## Getting Started

1. **Fork** the repository on GitHub
2. **Clone** your fork locally
3. **Create a branch** from `main` for your changes
4. **Make your changes** (see [Development Setup](#development-setup))
5. **Test** your changes
6. **Push** to your fork and open a **Pull Request**

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 22+
- npm 9+
- Docker and Docker Compose (for PostgreSQL)

### Quick Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/anythingmcp.git
cd anythingmcp
./setup.sh    # Choose "Local development" mode
npm run dev
```

### Manual Setup

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with local development values

# Start PostgreSQL
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d postgres

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Symlink .env for Prisma and Next.js
ln -sf ../../.env packages/backend/.env
ln -sf ../../.env packages/frontend/.env

# Run migrations
cd packages/backend
export $(grep -v '^#' ../../.env | grep -v '^$' | xargs)
npx prisma migrate dev
npx prisma generate
cd ../..

# Start dev servers
npm run dev
```

### Running Tests

```bash
npm test                          # All tests
cd packages/backend && npm test   # Backend only
```

## Making Changes

### Branch Naming

Use descriptive branch names:

- `fix/description` — Bug fixes
- `feat/description` — New features
- `docs/description` — Documentation changes
- `refactor/description` — Code refactoring

### Commit Messages

Write clear, concise commit messages:

- Use the imperative mood ("Add feature", not "Added feature")
- Keep the subject line under 72 characters
- Reference issues when applicable (e.g., "Fix #42")

### What We Accept

- Bug fixes with tests
- New connector engines or parsers
- Documentation improvements
- Performance improvements
- UI/UX enhancements
- New import format parsers (OpenAPI, Postman, cURL, etc.)

### What Needs Discussion First

Open an issue before starting work on:

- New connector types
- Changes to the authentication system
- Database schema changes
- Breaking API changes
- Large refactoring efforts

## Pull Request Process

1. **Update documentation** if your change affects user-facing behavior
2. **Add tests** for new functionality
3. **Ensure all tests pass** (`npm test`)
4. **Keep PRs focused** — one feature or fix per PR
5. **Fill out the PR template** with a clear description

### Review Process

- A maintainer will review your PR, usually within a few days
- You may be asked to make changes — this is normal and expected
- Once approved, a maintainer will merge your PR

## Reporting Bugs

Use the [Bug Report](https://github.com/HelpCode-ai/anythingmcp/issues/new?template=bug_report.yml) issue template. Include:

- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Environment details (OS, Node.js version, Docker version)
- Relevant logs or screenshots

## Requesting Features

Use the [Feature Request](https://github.com/HelpCode-ai/anythingmcp/issues/new?template=feature_request.yml) issue template. Include:

- The problem you're trying to solve
- Your proposed solution
- Alternatives you've considered

## Code Style

### TypeScript

- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Prefer `const` over `let`
- Use meaningful variable names
- Follow the existing NestJS patterns (modules, services, controllers)

### Backend (NestJS)

- One module per feature area
- Services handle business logic, controllers handle HTTP
- Use DTOs with `class-validator` for input validation
- Write unit tests for services (`.spec.ts` files alongside source)

### Frontend (Next.js)

- Use the App Router pattern
- Prefer server components where possible
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Follow existing component patterns

### General

- No unused imports or variables
- No `console.log` in production code (use NestJS `Logger`)
- Keep functions focused and small
- Add comments only where the "why" isn't obvious
